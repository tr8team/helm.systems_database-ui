## Working with CI

This template comes with in-built tools to debug CI.
CI Checks include:

- Pre Commit

### Dropping into an emulated environment

To enter an isolated CI-like environment to play around or test, run:

```
pls ci:isolate
```

If you require to enter the `nix-shell` under the `ci` attribute, you can run:

```
pls ci:isolate:nix-shell
```

### Executing specific CI

There are 3 methods to execute existing CI pipelines:

1. **Local Execution** - Execute the CI with your computer locally
2. **Emulated Environment** - Create a high-parity emulated and isolated environment to execute the CI
3. **Emulated Debug** - Like emulated, but drops you into the environment after the CI finishes for your to debug and explore

| CI         | Local Execution    | Emulated Environment       | Emulated Debug                   |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Pre-commit | `pls ci:precommit` | `pls ci:emulate:precommit` | `pls ci:emulate:precommit:debug` |
